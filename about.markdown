Hello =]

<img src="/blog/assets/face.jpg" width="250px" />

I am [Ajay](http://ajaymt.github.io/) and this is my "blog" (I am not sure whether it
really qualifies as a blog).

I intend to make this a somewhat-organized collection of thoughts on computer
science, mathematics and anything else that I happen to find interesting.

I will also use it as a way to document my progress working on various open-source
[projects](https://github.com/AjayMT).

Occasionally I will write about miscellaneous non-tech things.
